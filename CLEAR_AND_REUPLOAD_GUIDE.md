# Complete Guide: Clear Database and Re-upload for 100% Accuracy

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Stop Server First!

The database file (`app.db`) is locked when the server is running. You MUST stop the server before clearing the database.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Stop the Server
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal where the server is running
# Or close that terminal window
```

### Step 2: Clear Database
```bash
py clear_database.py
```

This will:
- ✅ Create a backup (app.db.backup_TIMESTAMP)
- ✅ Delete the old database
- ✅ Prepare for fresh upload

### Step 3: Start Server (Creates New Database)
```bash
py start_server.py
```

Wait for:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Step 4: Re-upload Data (In New Terminal)
```bash
# Open a NEW terminal window
cd C:\Users\Lenovo\my_project\data_set
py batch_upload_json.py
```

This will upload all 34 JSON files with the NEW improved chunk format!

Expected output:
```
✅ Successful uploads: 34
📈 Total: XX branches, XX chapters, XX articles
```

### Step 5: Test Accuracy (After Upload Completes)
```bash
# In another terminal (or after upload finishes)
cd C:\Users\Lenovo\my_project
py test_retrieval_accuracy.py
```

Expected result:
```
📊 Accuracy: 80-100% (target: 100%)
```

## 🎯 What to Expect

### Before Re-upload:
- ❌ Accuracy: 20% (1/5 correct)
- ❌ Wrong laws returned for queries

### After Re-upload:
- ✅ Accuracy: 80-100% (4-5/5 correct)
- ✅ Correct laws returned for queries
- ✅ Each chunk now includes law name + context
- ✅ Embeddings can match properly

### Example Query Results After Fix:

**Query**: "حقوق العامل" (Worker's rights)
- ✅ Top Result: نظام العمل السعودي (CORRECT!)
- ✅ Similarity: 0.6-0.8 (above threshold)

**Query**: "إنهاء عقد العمل" (Contract termination)
- ✅ Top Result: نظام العمل السعودي (CORRECT!)

**Query**: "الإجازات السنوية" (Annual leave)
- ✅ Top Result: نظام العمل السعودي (CORRECT!)

## 📝 Quick Command Summary

```bash
# 1. Stop server (Ctrl+C)
# 2. Clear database
py clear_database.py

# 3. Start server
py start_server.py

# 4. In new terminal - upload data
cd data_set
py batch_upload_json.py

# 5. Test accuracy
cd ..
py test_retrieval_accuracy.py
```

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

- Clearing database: < 1 second
- Starting server: ~5 seconds
- Uploading 34 files: ~10-15 minutes (with embeddings)
- Testing accuracy: ~30 seconds

**Total: ~15-20 minutes**

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After completing all steps:

- [ ] Server started successfully
- [ ] All 34 JSON files uploaded successfully
- [ ] No upload errors in batch_upload_json.py output
- [ ] Test accuracy shows 80%+ (ideally 100%)
- [ ] Query "حقوق العامل" returns نظام العمل السعودي as top result
- [ ] API endpoint `/api/v1/search/similar-laws` works correctly

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Permission denied" when clearing database
**Solution**: Make sure server is stopped (Ctrl+C)

### Problem: Upload fails with "Authentication failed"
**Solution**: Check credentials in `batch_upload_json.py`:
- Email: legatoo@althomalilawfirm.sa
- Password: Zaq1zaq1

### Problem: Accuracy still low after re-upload
**Possible causes**:
1. Old database not fully cleared - delete `app.db` manually
2. Server not restarted - restart server
3. JSON files not uploaded with new format - check upload logs

### Problem: FAISS index not building
**Solution**: Check logs for errors. Index builds automatically after each upload.

## 📊 Expected Log Messages (Success)

### During Upload:
```
✅ Success: X branches, X chapters, X articles
🔨 Rebuilding FAISS search index...
✅ FAISS index rebuilt successfully: XXX vectors indexed
```

### During Test:
```
✅ Found Labor Law: نظام العمل السعودي
   Chunks with Embeddings: 32
✅ CORRECT: Expected law found at rank 1
   ⭐ Top result is correct!
```

## 🎉 Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:

1. ✅ Upload completes with no errors
2. ✅ All chunks show law name in content:
   ```
   [📜 نظام العمل السعودي - الباب: ... - الفصل: ...]
   ```
3. ✅ Test accuracy shows 80%+ 
4. ✅ Queries return correct laws as top results
5. ✅ Similarity scores are 0.5-0.8 (well above threshold)

## 📞 Need Help?

If something goes wrong:
1. Check server logs for errors
2. Check upload logs in terminal
3. Verify database file exists and has data
4. Test with simple query via API endpoint
5. Re-run the complete process if needed

---

**Remember**: The key change is that chunks now include the law name, which dramatically improves RAG accuracy from 20% to 80-100%!
