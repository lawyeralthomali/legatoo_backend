# Clean Architecture Endpoints - Fixed Implementation

## âœ… **Issue Fixed**

The problem was that both the old `supabase_auth_router` and the new clean architecture `auth_routes` were being included in the application. The user was hitting the old endpoint which had dependency injection issues.

### **ðŸ”§ Root Cause:**
- Old `/api/v1/supabase-auth/signup` endpoint was still active
- It had incorrect dependency injection causing `'AsyncSession' object has no attribute 'get_profile_by_id'` error
- New clean architecture `/api/v1/auth/signup` endpoint was available but not being used

### **ðŸš€ Solution:**
- Removed old `supabase_auth_router` from main.py
- Now only the clean architecture endpoints are active
- Fixed dependency injection issues

## ðŸ“‹ **New Clean Architecture Endpoints**

### **Authentication Endpoints:**
- **POST** `/api/v1/auth/signup` - User registration with profile creation
- **POST** `/api/v1/auth/login` - User authentication
- **POST** `/api/v1/auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- **POST** `/api/v1/auth/logout` - User logout

### **User Management Endpoints:**
- **GET** `/api/v1/users/{user_id}` - Get user by ID
- **GET** `/api/v1/users/` - Get all users (with pagination)
- **GET** `/api/v1/users/search` - Search users
- **GET** `/api/v1/users/{user_id}/profile` - Get user's profile
- **GET** `/api/v1/users/{user_id}/complete` - Get user with profile

## ðŸ”§ **Unified Response Format**

All endpoints now return this consistent structure:

### **Success Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Operation successful",
  "data": {
    "user": {...},
    "profile": {...}
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

### **Error Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error description",
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "message": "This email is already in use."
    }
  ]
}
```

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Fixed Implementation**

### **Test Signup with Existing Email:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/auth/signup
{
  "email": "existing@example.com",
  "password": "Password123!",
  "first_name": "John",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "phone_number": "0509556183"
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Email already registered",
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "message": "This email is already in use."
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Test Successful Signup:**
```bash
POST /api/v1/auth/signup
{
  "email": "newuser@example.com",
  "password": "Password123!",
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Smith",
  "phone_number": "0509556184"
}
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User and profile created successfully",
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "email": "newuser@example.com",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "aud": "authenticated",
      "role": "authenticated"
    },
    "profile": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "first_name": "Jane",
      "last_name": "Smith",
      "phone_number": "0509556184",
      "account_type": "personal",
      "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Benefits of Clean Architecture Implementation**

1. **Proper Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with field-specific messages
2. **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns with proper DI
3. **Repository Pattern**: Data access layer properly abstracted
4. **Service Layer**: Business logic separated from HTTP concerns
5. **Unified Responses**: All endpoints follow the same response format
6. **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, dependency inversion, etc.

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

The clean architecture implementation is now ready for production use! All endpoints follow the unified response format and proper error handling. The old problematic endpoints have been removed, ensuring consistent behavior across the application.
