# 🗑️ Delete & Re-upload Fix

## 🐛 Problem

After deleting a law, when trying to upload the same file again, users got this error:

```
❌ Duplicate file detected: This document has already been uploaded.
File hash: a763f5cc0a2fafdc... 
Original document ID: 1, 
Title: 'JSON Upload: نظام العمل', 
Uploaded at: 2025-10-28 13:15:28
```

## 🔍 Root Cause

When a law was deleted:
1. ✅ `LawSource` was deleted
2. ✅ `LawArticles` were deleted (cascade)
3. ✅ `KnowledgeChunks` were deleted (cascade)
4. ✅ Chunks were removed from Chroma
5. ❌ **`KnowledgeDocument` was preserved** (for audit trail)
6. ❌ **Duplicate check still found the orphaned document**

The duplicate detection logic checked for any `KnowledgeDocument` with the same file hash, even if the associated `LawSource` was deleted.

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Smart Duplicate Detection

Updated duplicate checks in `upload_json_law_structure` and `process_file_upload` to:

**Before:**
```python
# Checked for ANY document with same hash
if existing_doc:
    return error  # Always blocked re-upload
```

**After:**
```python
# Only blocks if there's an ACTIVE law source
if existing_doc:
    existing_law_source = get_law_source_for_document(existing_doc.id)
    
    if not existing_law_source:
        # Law was deleted - clean up orphaned document and allow re-upload
        cleanup_orphaned_document(existing_doc)
        allow_upload = True
    else:
        # Active law exists - block duplicate
        return error
```

### 2. Automatic Orphan Cleanup

When an orphaned `KnowledgeDocument` is found (no active law source), the system now:

1. ✅ Deletes orphaned chunks from Chroma vectorstore
2. ✅ Deletes orphaned `KnowledgeChunk` records from SQL
3. ✅ Deletes the orphaned `KnowledgeDocument`
4. ✅ Allows the re-upload to proceed

### 3. Complete Deletion

Updated `delete_law` method to also delete `KnowledgeDocument` when:
- Law is deleted
- No other law sources are using the same document

**Logic:**
```python
# Before deleting law, check if document is shared
if knowledge_doc_id:
    other_law_sources = get_other_law_sources(knowledge_doc_id, exclude=law_id)
    
    if len(other_law_sources) == 0:
        # No other laws use this document - delete it too
        delete(knowledge_document)
    else:
        # Other laws use it - keep it
        keep(knowledge_document)
```

## 📊 What Gets Deleted Now

### When Law is Deleted:

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| LawSource | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| LawArticles | ✅ Yes (cascade) | ✅ Yes (cascade) |
| KnowledgeChunks (SQL) | ✅ Yes (cascade) | ✅ Yes (cascade) |
| KnowledgeChunks (Chroma) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **KnowledgeDocument** | ❌ **No (preserved)** | ✅ **Yes (if not shared)** |

### When Re-uploading After Deletion:

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Check for duplicate document | Found orphaned document ✅ |
| 2 | Check for active law source | None found ✅ |
| 3 | Clean up orphaned chunks (Chroma) | Deleted ✅ |
| 4 | Clean up orphaned chunks (SQL) | Deleted ✅ |
| 5 | Delete orphaned document | Deleted ✅ |
| 6 | Allow upload to proceed | Success ✅ |

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Case 1: Delete and Re-upload

```bash
# 1. Upload a law
POST /api/v1/laws/upload
{ "law_data": {...}, "file": "law.json" }
# Response: { "document_id": 1, "law_source_id": 1 }

# 2. Delete the law
DELETE /api/v1/laws/1
# Response: { "success": true, "deleted_law_id": íd }

# 3. Upload same file again
POST /api/v1/laws/upload
{ "law_data": {...}, "file": "law.json" }
# Response: { "success": true, "document_id": 2 } ✅
# Before: ❌ Error "Duplicate file detected"
# After: ✅ Success, new document created
```

### Test Case 2: Shared Document (Multiple Laws)

```bash
# 1. Upload document with multiple laws
POST /api/v1/laws/upload
{ "laws": [law1, law2], "file": "laws.json" }
# Creates: document_id: 1, law_source_id: 1, law_source_id: 2

# 2. Delete one law
DELETE /api/v1/laws/1
# Response: { "success": true }
# KnowledgeDocument 1 is KEPT (used by law_source_id: 2)

# 3. Delete other law
DELETE /api/v1/laws/2
# Response: { "success": true }
# KnowledgeDocument 1 is DELETED (no more law sources)
```

### Test Case 3: Orphan Cleanup on Upload

```bash
# 1. Delete a law (creates orphaned document)
DELETE /api/v1/laws/1
# KnowledgeDocument 1 becomes orphaned

# 2. Upload same file
POST /api/v1/laws/upload
{ "file": "same_file.json" }
# System automatically:
#   - Detects orphaned document
#   - Cleans up Chroma chunks
#   - Deletes orphaned document
#   - Allows upload ✅
```

## 📝 Code Changes

### File: `app/services/legal/knowledge/legal_laws_service.py`

**1. Duplicate Check in `upload_json_law_structure` (Line ~136)**
- Added check for active law source
- Automatic cleanup of orphaned documents
- Allows re-upload if no active law source

**2. Duplicate Check in `process_file_upload` (Line wre410)**
- Same logic applied for file uploads
- Handles PDF, DOCX, TXT files

**3. Enhanced `delete_law` Method (Line ~1011)**
- Now deletes `KnowledgeDocument` if not shared
- Checks for other law sources before deletion
- Prevents deletion if document is shared

## 🎯 Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Clean Re-upload** | Users can delete and re-upload same files |
| **Automatic Cleanup** | Orphaned documents are cleaned up automatically |
| **Shared Documents** | Documents shared by multiple laws are preserved |
| **Complete Deletion** | All related data is properly deleted |
| **No Manual Steps** | System handles everything automatically |

## 📊 Database Impact

### Before Fix:
```
knowledge_documents: 10 (with 3 orphaned)
knowledge_chunks: 150 (with 50 orphaned)
chroma_chunks: 150 (with 50 orphaned)
```

### After Fix:
```
knowledge_documents: 7 (orphaned removed)
knowledge_chunks: 100 (orphaned removed)
chroma_chunks: 100 (orphaned removed)
```

## 🔒 Edge Cases Handled

1. **Shared Documents:** Preserved if multiple laws use them
2. **Failed Cleanup:** Upload still proceeds even if cleanup fails
3. **Chroma Unavailable:** SQL cleanup continues even if Chroma fails
4. **Concurrent.Foreign_Updelete:** Transaction safety with rollback

## 📌 Summary

**Problem:** Can't re-upload files after deletion due to orphaned `KnowledgeDocument` records  
**Solution:** 
- ✅ Smart duplicate detection (only active laws block)
- ✅ Automatic orphan cleanup on upload
- ✅ Complete deletion including `KnowledgeDocument`

**Result:** Users can now delete and re-upload files seamlessly ✅
