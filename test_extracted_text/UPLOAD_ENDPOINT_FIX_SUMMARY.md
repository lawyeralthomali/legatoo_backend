# Upload Document Endpoint Hanging/Crash Fix

## üî¥ Problem Summary

The `/api/rag/upload-document` endpoint was causing the system to hang and crash Cursor due to **blocking CPU-intensive ML operations** running in async context.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Issues Identified:

1. **Missing Async Wrapper**
   - RAG service called `await self.embedding_service.initialize()` 
   - But only `initialize_model()` existed (synchronous, not async)
   - This caused AttributeError or blocking behavior

2. **Wrong Method Name**
   - RAG service called `generate_embeddings_batch(texts)`
   - Actual method was `generate_batch_embeddings(texts)`
   - Method mismatch caused errors

3. **Blocking ML Operations in Async Context**
   - `initialize_model()` - loads heavy ML models (1-2GB RAM)
   - `model.encode()` - CPU-intensive inference operations
   - These synchronous operations **blocked the entire async event loop**
   - Result: System freeze, high CPU usage, eventual crash

### Why It Hung:

```python
# ‚ùå BEFORE (Blocking)
def initialize_model(self):
    # This loads a 500MB+ model synchronously
    self.model = SentenceTransformer(model_path)  # BLOCKS EVENT LOOP
    self.model.encode(["test"])  # BLOCKS EVENT LOOP
```

When called in async context, this blocked all other async operations, causing:
- Event loop starvation
- High CPU usage (100%)
- Memory accumulation
- System becoming unresponsive
- Cursor/IDE crash

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Async Wrapper for Model Initialization

```python
# ‚úÖ AFTER (Non-blocking)
async def initialize(self) -> None:
    """Async wrapper for model initialization"""
    if self.model is None:
        # Run blocking operation in thread pool
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        await loop.run_in_executor(self._executor, self.initialize_model)
```

### 2. Wrapped Blocking Inference Operations

```python
# ‚úÖ Async wrapper for encoding
async def generate_embedding(self, text: str) -> List[float]:
    if self.model is None:
        await self.initialize()
    
    # Run blocking encoding in thread pool
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    embedding = await loop.run_in_executor(
        self._executor, 
        self._encode_text_sync, 
        text
    )
    return embedding
```

### 3. Added Thread Pool Executor

```python
def __init__(self, db: AsyncSession, model_name: str = 'legal_optimized'):
    # Thread pool for blocking operations
    self._executor = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2)
```

### 4. Added Method Aliases for Compatibility

```python
# Backward compatibility
async def generate_embeddings_batch(self, texts: List[str]) -> List[List[float]]:
    return await self.generate_batch_embeddings(texts)

def cosine_similarity(self, embedding1, embedding2) -> float:
    return self.calculate_similarity(embedding1, embedding2)
```

## üìã Files Modified

1. **`app/services/shared/embedding_service.py`**
   - Added `asyncio` and `ThreadPoolExecutor` imports
   - Added `_executor` thread pool
   - Created `async initialize()` method
   - Renamed `_encode_text()` to `_encode_text_sync()`
   - Updated `generate_embedding()` to use thread pool
   - Renamed `generate_batch_embeddings()` internals to `_encode_batch_sync()`
   - Added async wrappers with thread pool execution
   - Added backward compatibility aliases
   - Updated `validate_embedding_quality()` and `get_embedding_stats()`

## üß™ Testing

Created `test_upload_fix.py` to verify:
- ‚úÖ Endpoint responds without hanging
- ‚úÖ No blocking of event loop
- ‚úÖ Proper async execution
- ‚úÖ Successful document processing

### Run Test:

```bash
# Start server
python run.py

# In another terminal
python test_upload_fix.py
```

## üîß Technical Details

### Thread Pool Executor Strategy

- **Max Workers**: 2 (prevents resource exhaustion)
- **Purpose**: Isolates blocking CPU-intensive operations
- **Benefits**:
  - Event loop remains responsive
  - Other async operations can proceed
  - Prevents system freeze
  - Better resource management

### Performance Impact

- **Before**: System freeze, crash
- **After**: Smooth operation, no blocking
- **Trade-off**: Slight overhead from thread context switching (negligible)
- **Memory**: Same (model still loaded, but in thread)

## üìä Expected Behavior Now

1. User uploads document
2. File is validated (async)
3. Temporary file created (async)
4. RAG service initialized (async)
5. **Model loading runs in thread pool** (non-blocking)
6. **Embeddings generated in thread pool** (non-blocking)
7. Results saved to database (async)
8. Response returned to user

**Total time**: 10-30 seconds (depending on document size)
**System**: Remains responsive throughout

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes for Future

### Other Services to Check

The following services also use similar patterns and may need similar fixes:

1. **`ArabicLegalEmbeddingService`**
   - Also has synchronous `initialize_model()`
   - Uses `sentence_transformer.encode()` (blocking)
   - May need similar thread pool wrapping

2. **`LegalLawsService`**
   - Calls `_ensure_embedding_model_loaded()` synchronously
   - May cause blocking in async contexts

### Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Never** call blocking ML operations directly in async functions
2. **Always** use `asyncio.to_thread()` or `run_in_executor()` for:
   - Model loading
   - Model inference
   - Heavy computations
   - File I/O (large files)
   - Database bulk operations

3. **Use thread pools** for CPU-bound operations
4. **Use async I/O** for I/O-bound operations

- [x] No system hanging
- [x] No Cursor crash
- [x] Proper async execution
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [x] No performance degradation
