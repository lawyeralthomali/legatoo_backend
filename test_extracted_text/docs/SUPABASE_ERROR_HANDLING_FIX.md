# Supabase Error Handling Fix

## ‚úÖ **Issue Identified**

The signup process was showing "Database configuration error: Foreign key constraint violation" even when the foreign key constraint was properly set up. The real issue was in the error handling flow.

## üîç **Root Cause:**

1. **Supabase Client**: Correctly detects "already registered" errors and raises `HTTPException` with status 422
2. **AuthService**: Was catching `HTTPException` as a generic `Exception` and then trying to create a profile anyway
3. **Profile Creation**: Failed because the user already exists, causing the foreign key constraint error

## üîß **Solution Applied:**

### **Enhanced HTTPException Handling:**
```python
except HTTPException as e:
    logger.error(f"Supabase signup failed: {str(e)}")
    
    # Check if it's a duplicate email error from Supabase
    error_str = str(e.detail).lower()
    if "already registered" in error_str or "user already registered" in error_str or "email already exists" in error_str:
        raise ConflictException(
            message="Email already registered",
            field="email"
        )
    else:
        raise ExternalServiceException(
            message="User creation failed",
            field="email",
            service="Supabase",
            details={"error": str(e.detail)}
        )
```

### **Added HTTPException Import:**
```python
from fastapi import HTTPException
```

## üéØ **Expected Behavior Now:**

### **For Existing Email:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Email already registered",
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "message": "This email is already in use."
    }
  ]
}
```

### **For New Email:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "User and profile created successfully",
  "data": {
    "user": {...},
    "profile": {...}
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

## üöÄ **What This Fix Does:**

1. **Proper Exception Handling**: Catches `HTTPException` from Supabase client specifically
2. **Early Return**: Returns "Email already registered" error immediately when Supabase detects duplicate email
3. **No Profile Creation**: Prevents attempting to create a profile for an existing user
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Provides specific error messages for different failure scenarios

## ‚úÖ **Test the Fix:**

Try the signup request again with the same email:

```json
{
  "email": "mohammed211920@gmail.com",
  "password": "Mohammed11@",
  "first_name": "ali",
  "last_name": "mohammed",
  "phone_number": "0509556183"
}
```

You should now get the proper "Email already registered" response instead of the foreign key constraint error.

## üîß **Files Modified:**

1. **`app/services/auth_service.py`**:
   - Added `HTTPException` import
   - Enhanced exception handling to catch `HTTPException` specifically
   - Improved error message parsing for Supabase responses

The fix ensures that duplicate email errors are caught at the Supabase level and returned immediately, preventing the profile creation attempt that was causing the foreign key constraint error.
