# 🎯 General Guidelines
- Always write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- Follow PEP8 style guide and use clear, descriptive names.
- Add type hints for all function arguments and return values.
- Add docstrings for classes, functions, and complex logic.

# 🏗️ Project Structure
- Keep API endpoints in `app/routes/`.
- Keep business logic in `app/services/` (no database queries in routes).
- Keep database models in `app/models/`.
- Keep request/response validation in `app/schemas/`.
- Keep configuration in `app/config/`.
- Keep reusable helpers in `app/utils/`.

# 🗄️ Database
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM models, no raw SQL unless necessary.
- Define relationships clearly using `relationship`.
- Use Alembic for migrations, never change models directly in production DB.

# ⚡ API & Services
- Always validate input with Pydantic schemas.
- Return consistent responses (use schemas for output).
- Handle errors with `HTTPException` and meaningful status codes.
- Keep routes thin, put main logic in services.

# 🛠️ Best Practices
- Avoid code duplication: create helper functions when needed.
- Write modular and extensible code for future features.
- Use logging, not print, for debugging or errors.
- Always consider multi-user and multi-tenant support.

# ✅ Testing
- Add tests in `tests/` for new features.
- Use pytest fixtures for database setup/teardown.
